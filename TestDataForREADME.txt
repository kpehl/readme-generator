Project Title: 

Weather Dashboard

Description: 

This page provides a weather dashboard for a user. The user can search for a city with the form. The current date is displayed with the moment API. The Open Weather Map APIs are used to retrieve the current conditions: weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index; and a 5 day forecast for the city. The most recent 10 searches are retained in local storage and populated on a list below the search form. Clicking on a recent search will bring up the latest result for that city and move the city to the top of the recent searches list. API errors are captured and displayed in a user friendly format before reloading the page to try another search.

Installation:

No special installation is required.  Simply open the page in the browser of your choice. 

Usage:

This page is hosted at https://kpehl.github.io/weather-dashboard/ .  Search for a city, specifying the full state name or a country name if desired and either press the enter key or click on the search button. The results for that city will be displayed.

Test Instructions:

McMurdo is a good search for very cold temperatures and low UV indexes, as it is in Antartica! Key West, Florida is a good search for sunny, warm weather. Try cities in different time zones for seeing the difference between the daytime and nighttime weather icons, such as Seattle, New York, London, Moscow, and Tokyo.
