# Professional README Generator

## Project Description
This project uses Node to create a professional and detailed README.md file for a GitHub project using Markdown and following the guidelines outlined in:
[How to create a Professional README](./readme-guide.md)

## Tools Used to Create the Project
* JavaScript ES6
* Node.js
* npm inquirer
* [shields.io](https://choosealicense.com/) for the license badges

## Installation
* Clone the repository to your computer
* In the directory where you have the project saved, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. Depending on your current setup, you might need to:
    * Install Node.js from [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
        * The default settings are acceptable
    * Initialize npm 
        * type `npm init` in your command line
    * Install the inquirer package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
        * type `npm install inquirer`

## Usage
* From the command line in the directory with this project, type `node index` to run the program
* Answer the prompts with your information, or any mock data that you choose
* The application will create a README.md file with your inputs and notify you that the file was successfully created
* The README.md file can then be committed and pushed to the appropriate repository, or the markdown text can be copied into the README file on the GitHub website.
